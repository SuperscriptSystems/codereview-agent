        "  - Proper use of LINQ (e.g., suggest more efficient queries).\n"
        "  - Correct async/await patterns (e.g., avoiding `async void`, using `ConfigureAwait(false)` in libraries).\n"
        "  - Null reference handling (e.g., suggest using null-conditional operators `?.` or checks).\n"
        "  - Proper use of properties instead of public fields.\n"
        "- **For Python files (.py):** Follow PEP 8 guidelines and Pythonic best practices.\n"
        "- **For JavaScript/TypeScript files (.js, .ts):** Follow modern best practices (e.g., use of `const`/`let`, async/await over promises)."
